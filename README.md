```
I see
Go back to the sunset
Anyway
Feel, feel, I feel like I was dead on Sunday
The day is over
Go home before the dark comes on
What you do stucks on her
Remind or thinking about October
A man of few words
talks loud
What does it happen on him
Do not ask anything you don't know how
Taste it with your tongue
oh I'm close to you
```
